# Wanderer

Small project intended to become an online multiplayer rogue-like.
Take your time to see improvements although I'm doing my best :)


Here's the technologies this project uses:
  - C++, as main and only language
  - SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), for graphics only (yet)
  - ImGui (from Ocornut), for debugging windows
  - ImGUI-SFML, to make ImGUI work within SFML-created window
  (- EnTT (from skypjack) may be used later as the game grows [fast])
