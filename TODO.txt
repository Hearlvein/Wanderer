- add tiles outside of grid dimensions (done of x >= GRID_WIDTH)
- anti spam with sf::Clock
- add entity placement editor	...
- tilesWindow visibility (ImGUI?)
- reduce GRID_WIDTH when deleting single non-void from the last column
- maybe use std::list to store vertices to not invalidate pointers and avoid regenerateVertices()?
